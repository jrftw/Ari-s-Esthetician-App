4) Calendar Sync (Her Apple Calendar + Client Calendars)
A) Her Calendar (Apple Calendar supported)

(Alternative: subscribe to an iCal feed link; usually one-way view.)

If two people try at the same time, one succeeds and the other is prompted to choose another time

3️⃣ Deposit & No-Show Protection (Important)
How deposits work

Each service can have its own deposit amount

Deposit is paid before booking is confirmed

Deposit is:

Applied to the final service price OR

Kept if the client does not show up

No-Show Handling

If client is marked “no-show”:

Deposit is automatically kept

Appointment is logged

Client history reflects the no-show

Option to:

Block repeat no-show clients

Require higher deposits for flagged clients (optional later)

Rescheduling Rules

Reschedule before policy window → deposit moves to new appointment

Reschedule after cutoff → deposit forfeited (configurable)

4️⃣ Calendar Sync (Works with Any Calendar)
Her Calendar (Apple Calendar)

Best setup (recommended):

App syncs appointments to a Google Calendar

She adds that Google account to Apple Calendar on her iPhone

Appointments appear in Apple Calendar automatically

Why this is best:

Very reliable

Updates instantly (booked / moved / canceled)

No complicated setup

Client Calendars

Every client gets:

“Add to Calendar” button

Works with:

Apple Calendar

Google Calendar

Outlook

Any calendar app

5️⃣ Double-Booking Protection (Behind the Scenes)

The app checks availability when showing time slots

It checks again at payment confirmation

Only one booking can succeed for a time slot

If two people try at once, one is automatically rejected and asked to choose another time

This prevents race conditions and calendar conflicts.

6️⃣ Cost to Run (Very Affordable)
Typical monthly cost

Many months: $0–$10

With steady bookings + deposits: $10–$30

SMS reminders add extra (optional)

Why it stays cheap

No servers to manage

No heavy media storage

Efficient booking checks

Email is used first (cheap)

Payments

Deposit payments use Stripe

Stripe fee only applies when money is collected

No monthly Stripe subscription

7️⃣ What Can Be Added Later (Optional Upgrades)

Packages (3-session bundles)

Memberships (monthly facial plan)

Aftercare auto-messages

Review requests (Google/Yelp)

8️⃣ What She Needs to Provide to Launch

Business name

Working hours

Service list (name, duration, price, deposit)

Cancellation / no-show policy

Social links (Instagram, TikTok)

9️⃣ What This Solves for Her

✔ Stops no-shows
✔ Saves time texting clients
✔ Professional booking experience
✔ Calendar always up to date
✔ Full client history in one place
✔ She controls everything herself

Admin Dashboard Customization (Her “Control Panel”)
1) Services (fully self-managed)

She can add/edit/remove:

Service name, description, category

Duration + buffer time (cleanup/setup)

Price (and “starting at” option)

Hide/unhide (seasonal services)

Add-ons (phase 2)

Aftercare / prep notes per service

2) Hours & Availability (easy toggles)

Set weekly working hours by day

Multiple shifts per day (ex: 9–1 and 3–7)

Add breaks (lunch) and days off

Vacation/time-off blocks

“Closed” toggle for any day

3) Policies (editable text + enforcement rules)

Cancellation window (ex: 24 hours)

No-show policy (fee / strike / manual review)

Late policy (ex: 10-min grace)

Deposit policy (phase 2)

Display policies during booking + require checkbox agreement

4) Booking Rules (to prevent chaos)

Slot interval (15/30 min)

Min notice time (ex: can’t book within 6–12 hours)

Max days ahead (ex: 60 days)

Limit bookings per client per day (optional)

Require approval for certain services (optional)

5) Branding + Social (so it looks like “her”)

Logo, colors, salon name

Social buttons: Instagram/TikTok/Facebook

Address, contact, booking link + QR code

Calendar Sync (Apple / Google / Any Calendar App)
The reality (best UX + easiest to maintain)

Clients: easy — “Add to Calendar” works with Apple/Google/Outlook automatically.
Her calendar: we can do this in the most reliable way without expensive hosting.

A) Clients: “Add to Calendar” (works with any app)

After booking, they get:

Add to Apple Calendar

Add to Google Calendar

Add to Outlook

or a universal .ics calendar file/link
This works with basically every calendar app.

B) Her schedule: Apple Calendar sync (best approach)

If she “uses Apple Calendar,” the easiest reliable setup is:

Preferred method (recommended):

App syncs appointments to a Google Calendar behind the scenes

On her iPhone, she adds that Google account to Apple Calendar (built-in iOS feature)

Now everything appears inside Apple Calendar like it’s native

This is the cleanest because:

Google Calendar has strong APIs for automatic event creation/updates/cancels

Apple Calendar displays it perfectly once the account is added

It avoids complicated iCloud integrations

Alternative method (also great):

Provide her an iCal subscription feed URL (calendar “subscribe” link)

Apple Calendar can subscribe to it

This is very universal and cheap

Downside: it’s usually one-way view (still fine for most people)

True iCloud (direct write)

Possible in theory, but it’s a headache to do properly and securely at scale

Usually not worth it vs the Google→Apple display method

What Else Should We Add (high value, still simple)
Client experience upgrades

Automatic confirmations + reminders (email first; SMS optional)

Reschedule/cancel with rules (auto-enforced)

Intake notes (skin concerns, allergies) (phase 2)

Aftercare message automatically sent after the appointment

Admin power tools

Client directory with:

tags (VIP, sensitive skin, frequent cancels)

internal notes

full visit history

“Quick add appointment” (for walk-ins / Instagram DM bookings)

Status tracking (confirmed/arrived/completed/no-show)

Simple revenue view (daily/weekly/monthly totals)

Monetization + protection (optional)

Deposits / card holds to reduce no-shows

Packages (3-session bundle)

Memberships (monthly facial plan)

Gift cards (phase 2)

Keeping It Cheap (and still reliable)

To keep costs low:

Use Firebase + very lean database reads (load only the days she’s viewing)

Email confirmations (cheap) first

Add SMS only if she needs it

Calendar sync only triggers when an appointment changes (not constantly running)

This stays “small business cheap” and doesn’t require servers you manage.

Final Recommendation (Best setup for her)

Admin dashboard controls everything: services, hours, policies, branding, rules

Clients: Add-to-calendar works everywhere

Esthetician Booking App (iOS + Android + Web) — Flutter + Firebase + Google Calendar Sync (Cheap to Run)
What this is

A simple, professional booking system she can run from her phone that:

lets clients book appointments online

prevents double-booking automatically

keeps a searchable client directory + appointment history

syncs every appointment to her Google Calendar

lets clients add their appointment to their own calendar

stays very cheap to host and maintain

1) Key Features (What it will do)
A) Client Booking (Customers)

View services (price + duration)

Pick a day/time from only the available slots

Required info: First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone

Agree to policy checkbox (cancellation/no-show rules)

Confirm booking and receive a confirmation

Can reschedule/cancel (if allowed by policy)

Can add the appointment to their calendar (1 tap)

B) Admin (Her Control Center)

Calendar view (day/week)

Set working hours by weekday

Add time off / breaks (blocks)

Add/remove/edit services (duration, price, buffer time)

See all appointments + details + status

Search clients and see full history + notes

Manual appointment creation (walk-ins, Instagram DMs)

Policies/settings (cancellation window, min notice, max days ahead)

2) Google Calendar Sync (Her Calendar + Client Calendar)
A) Sync to HER Google Calendar (Automatic)

Every time someone books (or reschedules/cancels):

the app creates/updates/removes an event in her Google Calendar

the event includes:

service name

appointment time

client name

client phone/email (optional visibility settings)

notes/policies if needed

How we do it (reliably + safely)

She connects her Google account once (secure login)

The system stores a secure permission token (not her password)

A trusted backend function performs the calendar changes automatically

If Google Calendar is temporarily unavailable, it retries safely

Privacy option

In her calendar event title, we can show either:

“Hydrafacial — Jane D.” (privacy friendly)

or full client details if she wants

B) Clients Sync Their Appointment (Easy)

Clients don’t need to “connect accounts.”
They get:

“Add to Calendar” button on confirmation screen

The button provides:

iPhone/Apple Calendar support

Google Calendar support

Outlook support

This is done with a simple calendar event link / file so it works for everyone.

3) Cheap-to-Run Hosting Plan (Boyfriend-Friendly)
The cheapest reliable setup

Flutter + Firebase (Spark/Blaze)

Firebase Hosting (web app) is extremely cheap (often pennies)

Firestore database costs are low at small scale

Cloud Functions cost is low if usage is normal

Authentication is cheap/free for small usage

You only pay more if you have huge traffic

What keeps it cheap

No video uploads

No heavy analytics

No constant background processing

Efficient queries (only load one day’s schedule at a time)

Calendar sync only runs when an appointment changes

Estimated monthly cost (typical small business)

Many months can be near $0–$10

With steady bookings + reminders, typically $5–$25

SMS reminders (if enabled) can increase cost depending on volume
(Email reminders are much cheaper)

Tips to keep cost low

Start with email confirmations only

Add SMS later if she really wants it

Store only necessary client info + appointment data

Keep images/portfolio optional (or host on Instagram instead)

4) Screens List (What she will see)
Client (Customer) Screens

Booking Home

Business name, quick “Book Now”

Featured services

Social buttons (IG/TikTok)

6) Booking Logic (How it prevents double booking)
Availability rules

When a client is booking:

Only show times inside her working hours

Remove blocked times (vacation/lunch)

Remove any time that conflicts with existing appointments

Apply service duration + buffer time automatically

Enforce booking rules:

minimum notice (ex: 12 hours)

max days ahead (ex: 60 days)

slot spacing (ex: every 15 minutes)

Double-booking prevention (the important part)

Even if two people try to book the same slot at the same time:

the system re-checks conflicts at confirm time

only one booking is allowed to be created

the other person gets a message to pick another time

This is enforced on the backend so it can’t fail.

7) Google Calendar Sync Rules
When it syncs

Booking created → add Google Calendar event

Booking rescheduled → update event time

Booking canceled → remove event or mark canceled

If sync fails

Appointment still exists (no lost bookings)

System retries automatically

Admin can tap “Re-sync” if needed (optional)

8) Launch Plan (Fast + Practical)
Phase 1 (MVP — ship this first)

Phase 2 (Upgrades)

Review request automation

9) What I need from her (to set it up correctly)

Business name + timezone

Her normal working hours by day

Service list (name, duration, price)

Cancellation policy (ex: 24 hours)

Whether she wants:

clients to create accounts or “book as guest”

email only vs email + SMS

10) Outcome (Why this helps her)

Less time texting back and forth

No more double booking

One clean schedule synced to Google Calendar

Client history in one searchable place

Professional experience that feels like big salons, but customized for her

If you paste her service list + hours + policy, I’ll turn this into a one-page “spec sheet” you can hand to a developer (or keep as the build checklist).

Stripe: deposits and payments

SendGrid / Twilio: email/SMS

Why this works: reliable, scalable, fast to ship, minimal DevOps.

Option B: React Native + Next.js Web + Supabase

Also good, a bit more moving parts.

The “No Double Booking” Rule (Critical)

To make this rock-solid:

When a user selects a slot, you reserve it briefly (ex: 5 minutes) OR you do a final server-side validation on confirm.

On confirm:

Server checks overlap:

appointmentStart < existingEnd AND appointmentEnd > existingStart

If overlap exists → reject and refresh available times

Always enforce this on the backend, not only in the UI.
