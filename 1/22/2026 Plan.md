## 5. Double-Booking Prevention

### Guaranteed Protection

**Multi-Layer Checking:**

   - When showing time slots to client, system calculates availability
   - Only shows times that are:
     - Inside working hours
     - Not blocked (breaks, time off)
     - Not conflicting with existing appointments
     - Respecting service duration + buffer time
     - Meeting booking rules (min notice, max days ahead)

2. **Final Confirmation Check:**
   - Re-checks availability at checkout/confirm time (after deposit step)
   - Server-side validation ensures no conflicts
   - Only one booking can be created for a time slot

**Race Condition Protection:**
- If two people try to book the same slot simultaneously:
  - One booking succeeds
  - Other person is automatically rejected
  - Prompted to choose another available time
  - Available times refreshed automatically

**Backend Enforcement:**
- All conflict checking enforced on backend (server-side)
- Cannot be bypassed by client-side manipulation
- Overlap detection: checks if appointment times conflict with existing appointments
